# Merck - Corning Data Science Workshop

## Introduction to
As data project mature, data scientists may need make their script work on
new data, use them in broader use cases and with other collaborators. These challenges require them to build packages
that works with other people and tools. 

In this workshop we'll look at how to create functions with docstrings.
Then, we'll create and share a package that others can install.
Finally, we will make sure the code is performing as expected by writing some tests.
